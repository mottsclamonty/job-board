# J-Target Job Application Tracker

### What is it?
J-Target lets you keep track of ongoing job applications when you are in the process of searching for a new job. It allows you to:
- Signup for an account
- Add new job applications detailing the role, company, type of job (full-time, part-time, remote, internship), and application status (pending response, declined, interview scheduled)
- Search all uploaded jobs and filter results by position or date
- Keep track of the total number of applications in each status (pending/declined/interview)
- Track and visualize how many applications you submitted over the past 6 months, viewed as either a bar or area graph
- Login as a dummy user to try the app out

### What was used to built it?
J-Target is a fullstack application built using the MERN stack, as well as numerous packages to cover network security, routing, and data visualization.
